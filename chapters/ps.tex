\section{Pure Spinors}

We review and generalize the derived pure spinor formalism for a general class
of super Lie algebras. This might involve super flag varieties and a super
version of Springer theory. A starting point for the desired categorical
equivalences can be the work of Arkivpov, Bezrukavnikov and Ginzburg
\cite{Arkhipov03}.\\
A version of Koszul duality which takes advantage of derived algebraic geometry and
makes a connection with factorization algebras is the chiral Koszul duality of \cite{Francis11}.
