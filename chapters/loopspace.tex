\section{The relation the Koszul duality and the geometry of loop spaces} 

There is a close relation between the geometry of derived loop spaces and Koszul
duality. We investigate this starting from the work of Ben-Zvi, Nadler, Preygel
\cite{Preygel17}
and Chen \cite{Chen23}.\\
As explained for example in \cite{BenZvi12}, the derived loop space is related the
the algebraic de Rham complex. This indicates that the chiral de Rham complex as
discussed in \cite{BenZvi08} and \cite{Malikov99} are related to the chiral
Koszul duality in \cite{Francis11}. An explicit instance of a relation between
loop spaces and supersymmetry can be found in \cite{Kapranov10}.
