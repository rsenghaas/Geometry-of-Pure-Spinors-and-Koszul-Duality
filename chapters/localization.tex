\section{Algebraic Beilinson-Bernstein localization}

In this section we follow the notes \cite{ScholzeReal}.

Let $\fg$ be a reductive coplex Lie algebra.
Let $Fl$ be the flag variety of all Borel subalgebras $\fb \subset \fg$. 
There's the universal Cartan quotient $\fb \rightarrow \ft$, giving a sheaf of
commutative Lie algebras over $Fl$, which is constant, so there is a canonical
commutative Lie algebra $\fh$ over $\CC$ (\enquote{the universal Cartan}) with
an isomorphism $\fh|_{Fl} \ cong \ft$.

Also note that $\fg$ integrates to a smooth formal group $\hat{G}$ ( in the
level of functions, dual to $U(\fg)$ and $D_{qc} (* / \hat{g})$ gives the
derived category of $\fg$-modules.
